## About Me

I am a backend-focused software engineer with a strong foundation in **data structures, system design, and distributed systems**.  
My work centers on building **scalable, fault-tolerant, and secure backend systems**, with a particular interest in **storage systems, consensus protocols, and cloud infrastructure**.

I approach engineering problems from first principles and prioritize:
- correctness over shortcuts  
- scalability over local optimization  
- clarity over cleverness  

I am actively preparing for high-bar engineering roles at companies like :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, where system design depth and problem-solving rigor matter more than surface-level tooling.

## Technical Focus Areas

**Core Computer Science**
- Data Structures & Algorithms (problem-solving driven, not memorization)
- Concurrency & Multithreading
- Operating System fundamentals
- Networking basics (TCP/IP, HTTP, async IO)

**Backend & Systems**
- Distributed systems fundamentals (replication, sharding, leader election)
- Storage engines (LSM trees, WALs, compaction concepts)
- API design and backend architecture
- Performance tuning and debugging

**Languages & Frameworks**
- Java (primary)
- JavaScript / Node.js
- Spring Boot, RESTful services
- Familiar with async and event-driven models

**Cloud & Security**
- Cloud fundamentals (AWS)
- Secure backend design
- Authentication, authorization, and access control
- Basic exposure to DFIR and cloud security concepts

## What You’ll Find in My Repositories

- **Backend-heavy projects** focused on real engineering problems  
- **System-level implementations**, not CRUD demos  
- Code written with readability, modularity, and extensibility in mind  
- Incremental commits that reflect actual engineering workflows  

I value **depth over volume**.  
A smaller number of serious projects matters more than many shallow ones.

---

## Engineering Philosophy

- I prefer **simple designs that scale** over complex designs that impress.
- I document trade-offs explicitly.
- I treat production failures as learning signals, not mistakes.
- I believe strong engineers can explain *why* something works, not just *how*.

---

## Current Direction

- Deepening expertise in **distributed storage systems**
- Strengthening **system design and low-level design**
- Building production-style backend systems
- Preparing for high-bar technical interviews
